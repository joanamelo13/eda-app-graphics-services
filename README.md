# Application for a graphic publisher

This repository corresponds to the application of a 
graphic that organizes its orders and customers 
using Advanced Data Structures.

To carry out this implementation we use the C language 
and Hash and Binary Tree Advanced Data Structures (AVL), 
in addition to basic language elements such as pointers, 
structs and dynamic allocation.

This project was developed collaboratively with 
the developer Wesley Farias (@wesley3979).
